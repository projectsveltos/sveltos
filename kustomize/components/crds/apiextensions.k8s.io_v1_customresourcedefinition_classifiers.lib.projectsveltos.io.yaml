                      AggregatedClassification is optional and can be used to specify a Lua function
                      that will be used to further detect whether the subset of the resources
                      selected using the ResourceSelector field are a match for this Classifier.
                      The function will receive the array of resources selected by ResourceSelectors.
                      If this field is not specified, a cluster is a match for Classifier instance,
                      if all ResourceSelectors returns at least one match.
                      This field allows to perform more complex evaluation  on the resources, looking
                      at all resources together.
                      This can be useful for more sophisticated tasks, such as identifying resources
                      that are related to each other or that have similar properties.
                      The Lua function must return a struct with:
                      - "matching" field: boolean indicating whether cluster is a match;

                      AggregatedClassification is optional and can be used to specify a Lua function
                      that will be used to further detect whether the subset of the resources
                      selected using the ResourceSelector field are a match for this Classifier.
                      The function will receive the array of resources selected by ResourceSelectors.
                      If this field is not specified, a cluster is a match for Classifier instance,
                      if all ResourceSelectors returns at least one match.
                      This field allows to perform more complex evaluation  on the resources, looking
                      at all resources together.
                      This can be useful for more sophisticated tasks, such as identifying resources
                      that are related to each other or that have similar properties.
                      The Lua function must return a struct with:
                      - "matching" field: boolean indicating whether cluster is a match;

                            If referring to a piece of an object instead of an entire object, this string
                            should contain a valid JSON/Go field access statement, such as desiredState.manifest.containers[2].
                            For example, if the object reference is to a container within a pod, this would take on a value like:
                            "spec.containers{name}" (where "name" refers to the name of the container that triggered
                            the event) or if no container name is specified "spec.containers[2]" (container with
                            index 2 in this pod). This syntax is chosen only to have some well-defined way of
                            referencing a part of an object.
