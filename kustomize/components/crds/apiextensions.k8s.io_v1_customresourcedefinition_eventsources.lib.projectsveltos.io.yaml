                  This field is optional and can be used to specify a Lua function
                  that will be used to further select a subset of the resources that
                  have already been selected using the ResourceSelector field.
                  The function will receive the array of resources selected by ResourceSelectors.
                  If this field is not specified, all resources selected by the ResourceSelector
                  field will be considered.
                  This field allows to perform more complex filtering or selection operations
                  on the resources, looking at all resources together.

                  that are related to each other or that have similar properties.
                  The Lua function must return a struct with:
