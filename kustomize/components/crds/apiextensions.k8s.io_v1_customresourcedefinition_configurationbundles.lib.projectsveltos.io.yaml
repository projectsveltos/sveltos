                  NotTracked, when true, signifies that the resources managed by the
                  ConfigurationBundles should not be tracked for conflicts
                  with other configurations and will not be automatically removed when the
                  ConfigurationGroup is deleted. This is intended for resources like
                  Sveltos CRDs or the agents Sveltos deploys in the managed clusters.
