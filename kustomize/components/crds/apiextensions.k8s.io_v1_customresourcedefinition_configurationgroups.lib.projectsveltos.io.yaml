                  Tier controls the order of deployment for ClusterProfile or Profile resources targeting

                  Imagine two configurations (ClusterProfiles or Profiles) trying to deploy the same resource (a Kubernetes
                  resource or an helm chart). By default, the first one to reach the cluster "wins" and deploys it.
                  Tier allows you to override this. When conflicts arise, the ClusterProfile or Profile with the **lowest**
                  Tier value takes priority and deploys the resource.
                  Higher Tier values represent lower priority. The default Tier value is 100.
                  Using Tiers provides finer control over resource deployment within your cluster, particularly useful
                  when multiple configurations manage the same resources.
