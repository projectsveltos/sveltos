                      AggregatedClassification is optional and can be used to specify a Lua function

                      selected using the ResourceSelector field are a match for this Classifier.
                      The function will receive the array of resources selected by ResourceSelectors.
                      If this field is not specified, a cluster is a match for Classifier instance,
                      if all ResourceSelectors returns at least one match.
                      This field allows to perform more complex evaluation  on the resources, looking
                      at all resources together.
                      This can be useful for more sophisticated tasks, such as identifying resources
                      that are related to each other or that have similar properties.
                      The Lua function must return a struct with:
                      - "matching" field: boolean indicating whether cluster is a match;

                      AggregatedClassification is optional and can be used to specify a Lua function

                      selected using the ResourceSelector field are a match for this Classifier.
                      The function will receive the array of resources selected by ResourceSelectors.
                      If this field is not specified, a cluster is a match for Classifier instance,
                      if all ResourceSelectors returns at least one match.
                      This field allows to perform more complex evaluation  on the resources, looking
                      at all resources together.
                      This can be useful for more sophisticated tasks, such as identifying resources
                      that are related to each other or that have similar properties.
                      The Lua function must return a struct with:
                      - "matching" field: boolean indicating whether cluster is a match;

                            For example, if the object reference is to a container within a pod, this would take on a value like:
                            "spec.containers{name}" (where "name" refers to the name of the container that triggered

                    ---
                    New uses of this type are discouraged because of difficulty describing its usage when embedded in APIs.
                     1. Ignored fields.  It includes many fields which are not generally honored.  For instance, ResourceVersion and FieldPath are both very rarely valid in actual usage.
                     2. Invalid usage help.  It is impossible to add specific help for individual usage.  In most embedded usages, there are particular
                        restrictions like, "must refer only to types A and B" or "UID not honored" or "name must be restricted".
                        Those cannot be well described when embedded.
                     3. Inconsistent validation.  Because the usages are different, the validation rules are different by usage, which makes it hard for users to predict what will happen.
                     4. The fields are both imprecise and overly precise.  Kind is not a precise mapping to a URL. This can produce ambiguity
                        during interpretation and require a REST mapping.  In most cases, the dependency is on the group,resource tuple
                        and the version of the actual struct is irrelevant.
                     5. We cannot easily change it.  Because this type is embedded in many locations, updates to this type
                        will affect numerous schemas.  Don't make new APIs embed an underspecified API type they do not control.


                    Instead of using this type, create a locally provided and used type that is well-focused on your reference.

                    New uses of this type are discouraged because of difficulty describing its usage when embedded in APIs.
                     1. Ignored fields.  It includes many fields which are not generally honored.  For instance, ResourceVersion and FieldPath are both very rarely valid in actual usage.
                     2. Invalid usage help.  It is impossible to add specific help for individual usage.  In most embedded usages, there are particular
                        restrictions like, "must refer only to types A and B" or "UID not honored" or "name must be restricted".
                        Those cannot be well described when embedded.
                     3. Inconsistent validation.  Because the usages are different, the validation rules are different by usage, which makes it hard for users to predict what will happen.
                     4. The fields are both imprecise and overly precise.  Kind is not a precise mapping to a URL. This can produce ambiguity
                        during interpretation and require a REST mapping.  In most cases, the dependency is on the group,resource tuple
                        and the version of the actual struct is irrelevant.
                     5. We cannot easily change it.  Because this type is embedded in many locations, updates to this type
                        will affect numerous schemas.  Don't make new APIs embed an underspecified API type they do not control.


                    Instead of using this type, create a locally provided and used type that is well-focused on your reference.
                    For example, ServiceReferences for admission registration: https://github.com/kubernetes/api/blob/release-1.17/admissionregistration/v1/types.go#L533 .

                        If referring to a piece of an object instead of an entire object, this string
                        should contain a valid JSON/Go field access statement, such as desiredState.manifest.containers[2].
                        For example, if the object reference is to a container within a pod, this would take on a value like:
                        "spec.containers{name}" (where "name" refers to the name of the container that triggered
                        the event) or if no container name is specified "spec.containers[2]" (container with
                        index 2 in this pod). This syntax is chosen only to have some well-defined way of
                        referencing a part of an object.

                    New uses of this type are discouraged because of difficulty describing its usage when embedded in APIs.
                     1. Ignored fields.  It includes many fields which are not generally honored.  For instance, ResourceVersion and FieldPath are both very rarely valid in actual usage.
                     2. Invalid usage help.  It is impossible to add specific help for individual usage.  In most embedded usages, there are particular
                        restrictions like, "must refer only to types A and B" or "UID not honored" or "name must be restricted".
                        Those cannot be well described when embedded.
                     3. Inconsistent validation.  Because the usages are different, the validation rules are different by usage, which makes it hard for users to predict what will happen.
                     4. The fields are both imprecise and overly precise.  Kind is not a precise mapping to a URL. This can produce ambiguity
                        during interpretation and require a REST mapping.  In most cases, the dependency is on the group,resource tuple
                        and the version of the actual struct is irrelevant.
                     5. We cannot easily change it.  Because this type is embedded in many locations, updates to this type
                        will affect numerous schemas.  Don't make new APIs embed an underspecified API type they do not control.


                    Instead of using this type, create a locally provided and used type that is well-focused on your reference.

                        For example, if the object reference is to a container within a pod, this would take on a value like:
                        "spec.containers{name}" (where "name" refers to the name of the container that triggered

                    New uses of this type are discouraged because of difficulty describing its usage when embedded in APIs.
                     1. Ignored fields.  It includes many fields which are not generally honored.  For instance, ResourceVersion and FieldPath are both very rarely valid in actual usage.
                     2. Invalid usage help.  It is impossible to add specific help for individual usage.  In most embedded usages, there are particular
                        restrictions like, "must refer only to types A and B" or "UID not honored" or "name must be restricted".
                        Those cannot be well described when embedded.
                     3. Inconsistent validation.  Because the usages are different, the validation rules are different by usage, which makes it hard for users to predict what will happen.
                     4. The fields are both imprecise and overly precise.  Kind is not a precise mapping to a URL. This can produce ambiguity
                        during interpretation and require a REST mapping.  In most cases, the dependency is on the group,resource tuple
                        and the version of the actual struct is irrelevant.
                     5. We cannot easily change it.  Because this type is embedded in many locations, updates to this type
                        will affect numerous schemas.  Don't make new APIs embed an underspecified API type they do not control.


                    Instead of using this type, create a locally provided and used type that is well-focused on your reference.
                    For example, ServiceReferences for admission registration: https://github.com/kubernetes/api/blob/release-1.17/admissionregistration/v1/types.go#L533 .

                    apiVersion:

                        For example, if the object reference is to a container within a pod, this would take on a value like:
                        "spec.containers{name}" (where "name" refers to the name of the container that triggered

                    New uses of this type are discouraged because of difficulty describing its usage when embedded in APIs.
                     1. Ignored fields.  It includes many fields which are not generally honored.  For instance, ResourceVersion and FieldPath are both very rarely valid in actual usage.
                     2. Invalid usage help.  It is impossible to add specific help for individual usage.  In most embedded usages, there are particular
                        restrictions like, "must refer only to types A and B" or "UID not honored" or "name must be restricted".
                        Those cannot be well described when embedded.
                     3. Inconsistent validation.  Because the usages are different, the validation rules are different by usage, which makes it hard for users to predict what will happen.
                     4. The fields are both imprecise and overly precise.  Kind is not a precise mapping to a URL. This can produce ambiguity
                        during interpretation and require a REST mapping.  In most cases, the dependency is on the group,resource tuple
                        and the version of the actual struct is irrelevant.
                     5. We cannot easily change it.  Because this type is embedded in many locations, updates to this type
                        will affect numerous schemas.  Don't make new APIs embed an underspecified API type they do not control.


                    Instead of using this type, create a locally provided and used type that is well-focused on your reference.
                    For example, ServiceReferences for admission registration: https://github.com/kubernetes/api/blob/release-1.17/admissionregistration/v1/types.go#L533 .
                  properties:
                    apiVersion:

                      description: |-
                        If referring to a piece of an object instead of an entire object, this string
                        should contain a valid JSON/Go field access statement, such as desiredState.manifest.containers[2].
                        For example, if the object reference is to a container within a pod, this would take on a value like:
                        "spec.containers{name}" (where "name" refers to the name of the container that triggered
                        the event) or if no container name is specified "spec.containers[2]" (container with
                        index 2 in this pod). This syntax is chosen only to have some well-defined way of
                        referencing a part of an object.

                            For example, if the object reference is to a container within a pod, this would take on a value like:
                            "spec.containers{name}" (where "name" refers to the name of the container that triggered

                            For example, if the object reference is to a container within a pod, this would take on a value like:
                            "spec.containers{name}" (where "name" refers to the name of the container that triggered

                    ---
                    New uses of this type are discouraged because of difficulty describing its usage when embedded in APIs.
                     1. Ignored fields.  It includes many fields which are not generally honored.  For instance, ResourceVersion and FieldPath are both very rarely valid in actual usage.
                     2. Invalid usage help.  It is impossible to add specific help for individual usage.  In most embedded usages, there are particular
                        restrictions like, "must refer only to types A and B" or "UID not honored" or "name must be restricted".
                        Those cannot be well described when embedded.
                     3. Inconsistent validation.  Because the usages are different, the validation rules are different by usage, which makes it hard for users to predict what will happen.
                     4. The fields are both imprecise and overly precise.  Kind is not a precise mapping to a URL. This can produce ambiguity
                        during interpretation and require a REST mapping.  In most cases, the dependency is on the group,resource tuple
                        and the version of the actual struct is irrelevant.
                     5. We cannot easily change it.  Because this type is embedded in many locations, updates to this type
                        will affect numerous schemas.  Don't make new APIs embed an underspecified API type they do not control.


                    Instead of using this type, create a locally provided and used type that is well-focused on your reference.

                    New uses of this type are discouraged because of difficulty describing its usage when embedded in APIs.
                     1. Ignored fields.  It includes many fields which are not generally honored.  For instance, ResourceVersion and FieldPath are both very rarely valid in actual usage.
                     2. Invalid usage help.  It is impossible to add specific help for individual usage.  In most embedded usages, there are particular
                        restrictions like, "must refer only to types A and B" or "UID not honored" or "name must be restricted".
                        Those cannot be well described when embedded.
                     3. Inconsistent validation.  Because the usages are different, the validation rules are different by usage, which makes it hard for users to predict what will happen.
                     4. The fields are both imprecise and overly precise.  Kind is not a precise mapping to a URL. This can produce ambiguity
                        during interpretation and require a REST mapping.  In most cases, the dependency is on the group,resource tuple
                        and the version of the actual struct is irrelevant.
                     5. We cannot easily change it.  Because this type is embedded in many locations, updates to this type
                        will affect numerous schemas.  Don't make new APIs embed an underspecified API type they do not control.

                    New uses of this type are discouraged because of difficulty describing its usage when embedded in APIs.
                     1. Ignored fields.  It includes many fields which are not generally honored.  For instance, ResourceVersion and FieldPath are both very rarely valid in actual usage.
                     2. Invalid usage help.  It is impossible to add specific help for individual usage.  In most embedded usages, there are particular
                        restrictions like, "must refer only to types A and B" or "UID not honored" or "name must be restricted".
                        Those cannot be well described when embedded.
                     3. Inconsistent validation.  Because the usages are different, the validation rules are different by usage, which makes it hard for users to predict what will happen.
                     4. The fields are both imprecise and overly precise.  Kind is not a precise mapping to a URL. This can produce ambiguity
                        during interpretation and require a REST mapping.  In most cases, the dependency is on the group,resource tuple
                        and the version of the actual struct is irrelevant.

                    New uses of this type are discouraged because of difficulty describing its usage when embedded in APIs.
                     1. Ignored fields.  It includes many fields which are not generally honored.  For instance, ResourceVersion and FieldPath are both very rarely valid in actual usage.
                     2. Invalid usage help.  It is impossible to add specific help for individual usage.  In most embedded usages, there are particular
                        restrictions like, "must refer only to types A and B" or "UID not honored" or "name must be restricted".
                        Those cannot be well described when embedded.
                     3. Inconsistent validation.  Because the usages are different, the validation rules are different by usage, which makes it hard for users to predict what will happen.
                     4. The fields are both imprecise and overly precise.  Kind is not a precise mapping to a URL. This can produce ambiguity
                        during interpretation and require a REST mapping.  In most cases, the dependency is on the group,resource tuple
                        and the version of the actual struct is irrelevant.
                     5. We cannot easily change it.  Because this type is embedded in many locations, updates to this type
                        will affect numerous schemas.  Don't make new APIs embed an underspecified API type they do not control.


                    Instead of using this type, create a locally provided and used type that is well-focused on your reference.
                    For example, ServiceReferences for admission registration: https://github.com/kubernetes/api/blob/release-1.17/admissionregistration/v1/types.go#L533 .

                        For example, if the object reference is to a container within a pod, this would take on a value like:
                        "spec.containers{name}" (where "name" refers to the name of the container that triggered

                                        For example, if the object reference is to a container within a pod, this would take on a value like:
                                        "spec.containers{name}" (where "name" refers to the name of the container that triggered

                                        If referring to a piece of an object instead of an entire object, this string
                                        should contain a valid JSON/Go field access statement, such as desiredState.manifest.containers[2].
                                        For example, if the object reference is to a container within a pod, this would take on a value like:
                                        "spec.containers{name}" (where "name" refers to the name of the container that triggered
                                        the event) or if no container name is specified "spec.containers[2]" (container with
                                        index 2 in this pod). This syntax is chosen only to have some well-defined way of
                                        referencing a part of an object.

                                        If referring to a piece of an object instead of an entire object, this string
                                        should contain a valid JSON/Go field access statement, such as desiredState.manifest.containers[2].
                                        For example, if the object reference is to a container within a pod, this would take on a value like:
                                        "spec.containers{name}" (where "name" refers to the name of the container that triggered
                                        the event) or if no container name is specified "spec.containers[2]" (container with
                                        index 2 in this pod). This syntax is chosen only to have some well-defined way of
                                        referencing a part of an object.

                    New uses of this type are discouraged because of difficulty describing its usage when embedded in APIs.
                     1. Ignored fields.  It includes many fields which are not generally honored.  For instance, ResourceVersion and FieldPath are both very rarely valid in actual usage.
                     2. Invalid usage help.  It is impossible to add specific help for individual usage.  In most embedded usages, there are particular
                        restrictions like, "must refer only to types A and B" or "UID not honored" or "name must be restricted".
                        Those cannot be well described when embedded.
                     3. Inconsistent validation.  Because the usages are different, the validation rules are different by usage, which makes it hard for users to predict what will happen.
                     4. The fields are both imprecise and overly precise.  Kind is not a precise mapping to a URL. This can produce ambiguity
                        during interpretation and require a REST mapping.  In most cases, the dependency is on the group,resource tuple
                        and the version of the actual struct is irrelevant.
                     5. We cannot easily change it.  Because this type is embedded in many locations, updates to this type
                        will affect numerous schemas.  Don't make new APIs embed an underspecified API type they do not control.

                    Instead of using this type, create a locally provided and used type that is well-focused on your reference.

                        Values is a map[string]string type that allows to define a set of key-value pairs.
                        These key-value pairs can optionally leverage Go templates for further processing.
                        With Sveltos, you can define key-value pairs where the values can be Go templates.
                        These templates have access to management cluster information during deployment. This allows
                        to do more than just replace placeholders. Variables can be used to dynamically
                        construct values based on other resources or variables within the Kustomize output.
                        For example, imagine you have a Region key with a template value like:
                        '{{ index .Cluster.metadata.labels "region" }}'.
                        This template retrieves the region label from the cluster instance metadata.
                        Finally, Sveltos uses these processed values to fill placeholders in the Kustomize output.
                        The output itself can also contain templates, like:
                        region: '{{ default "west" .Region }}'.
                        This way, the final output from Kustomize will have the region set dynamically based on
                        the actual region retrieved earlier.

                  Tier controls the order of deployment for ClusterProfile or Profile resources targeting
                  the same cluster resources.
                  Imagine two configurations (ClusterProfiles or Profiles) trying to deploy the same resource (a Kubernetes
                  resource or an helm chart). By default, the first one to reach the cluster "wins" and deploys it.
                  Tier allows you to override this. When conflicts arise, the ClusterProfile or Profile with the **lowest**
                  Tier value takes priority and deploys the resource.
                  Higher Tier values represent lower priority. The default Tier value is 100.
                  Using Tiers provides finer control over resource deployment within your cluster, particularly useful
                  when multiple configurations manage the same resources.

                    New uses of this type are discouraged because of difficulty describing its usage when embedded in APIs.
                     1. Ignored fields.  It includes many fields which are not generally honored.  For instance, ResourceVersion and FieldPath are both very rarely valid in actual usage.
                     2. Invalid usage help.  It is impossible to add specific help for individual usage.  In most embedded usages, there are particular
                        restrictions like, "must refer only to types A and B" or "UID not honored" or "name must be restricted".
                        Those cannot be well described when embedded.
                     3. Inconsistent validation.  Because the usages are different, the validation rules are different by usage, which makes it hard for users to predict what will happen.
                     4. The fields are both imprecise and overly precise.  Kind is not a precise mapping to a URL. This can produce ambiguity
                        during interpretation and require a REST mapping.  In most cases, the dependency is on the group,resource tuple
                        and the version of the actual struct is irrelevant.
                     5. We cannot easily change it.  Because this type is embedded in many locations, updates to this type
                        will affect numerous schemas.  Don't make new APIs embed an underspecified API type they do not control.

                    Instead of using this type, create a locally provided and used type that is well-focused on your reference.

                        New uses of this type are discouraged because of difficulty describing its usage when embedded in APIs.
                         1. Ignored fields.  It includes many fields which are not generally honored.  For instance, ResourceVersion and FieldPath are both very rarely valid in actual usage.
                         2. Invalid usage help.  It is impossible to add specific help for individual usage.  In most embedded usages, there are particular
                            restrictions like, "must refer only to types A and B" or "UID not honored" or "name must be restricted".
                            Those cannot be well described when embedded.
                         3. Inconsistent validation.  Because the usages are different, the validation rules are different by usage, which makes it hard for users to predict what will happen.
                         4. The fields are both imprecise and overly precise.  Kind is not a precise mapping to a URL. This can produce ambiguity
                            during interpretation and require a REST mapping.  In most cases, the dependency is on the group,resource tuple
                            and the version of the actual struct is irrelevant.
                         5. We cannot easily change it.  Because this type is embedded in many locations, updates to this type
                            will affect numerous schemas.  Don't make new APIs embed an underspecified API type they do not control.

                        Instead of using this type, create a locally provided and used type that is well-focused on your reference.
                        For example, ServiceReferences for admission registration: https://github.com/kubernetes/api/blob/release-1.17/admissionregistration/v1/types.go#L533 .

                            For example, if the object reference is to a container within a pod, this would take on a value like:
                            "spec.containers{name}" (where "name" refers to the name of the container that triggered

                        Values is a map[string]string type that allows to define a set of key-value pairs.
                        These key-value pairs can optionally leverage Go templates for further processing.
                        With Sveltos, you can define key-value pairs where the values can be Go templates.
                        These templates have access to management cluster information during deployment. This allows
                        to do more than just replace placeholders. Variables can be used to dynamically
                        construct values based on other resources or variables within the Kustomize output.
                        For example, imagine you have a Region key with a template value like:
                        '{{ index .Cluster.metadata.labels "region" }}'.
                        This template retrieves the region label from the cluster instance metadata.
                        Finally, Sveltos uses these processed values to fill placeholders in the Kustomize output.
                        The output itself can also contain templates, like:
                        region: '{{ default "west" .Region }}'.
                        This way, the final output from Kustomize will have the region set dynamically based on
                        the actual region retrieved earlier.

                  Tier controls the order of deployment for ClusterProfile or Profile resources targeting
                  the same cluster resources.
                  Imagine two configurations (ClusterProfiles or Profiles) trying to deploy the same resource (a Kubernetes
                  resource or an helm chart). By default, the first one to reach the cluster "wins" and deploys it.
                  Tier allows you to override this. When conflicts arise, the ClusterProfile or Profile with the **lowest**
                  Tier value takes priority and deploys the resource.
                  Higher Tier values represent lower priority. The default Tier value is 100.
                  Using Tiers provides finer control over resource deployment within your cluster, particularly useful
                  when multiple configurations manage the same resources.

                    New uses of this type are discouraged because of difficulty describing its usage when embedded in APIs.
                     1. Ignored fields.  It includes many fields which are not generally honored.  For instance, ResourceVersion and FieldPath are both very rarely valid in actual usage.
                     2. Invalid usage help.  It is impossible to add specific help for individual usage.  In most embedded usages, there are particular
                        restrictions like, "must refer only to types A and B" or "UID not honored" or "name must be restricted".
                        Those cannot be well described when embedded.
                     3. Inconsistent validation.  Because the usages are different, the validation rules are different by usage, which makes it hard for users to predict what will happen.
                     4. The fields are both imprecise and overly precise.  Kind is not a precise mapping to a URL. This can produce ambiguity
                        during interpretation and require a REST mapping.  In most cases, the dependency is on the group,resource tuple
                        and the version of the actual struct is irrelevant.
                     5. We cannot easily change it.  Because this type is embedded in many locations, updates to this type
                        will affect numerous schemas.  Don't make new APIs embed an underspecified API type they do not control.

                    Instead of using this type, create a locally provided and used type that is well-focused on your reference.

                        New uses of this type are discouraged because of difficulty describing its usage when embedded in APIs.
                         1. Ignored fields.  It includes many fields which are not generally honored.  For instance, ResourceVersion and FieldPath are both very rarely valid in actual usage.
                         2. Invalid usage help.  It is impossible to add specific help for individual usage.  In most embedded usages, there are particular
                            restrictions like, "must refer only to types A and B" or "UID not honored" or "name must be restricted".
                            Those cannot be well described when embedded.
                         3. Inconsistent validation.  Because the usages are different, the validation rules are different by usage, which makes it hard for users to predict what will happen.
                         4. The fields are both imprecise and overly precise.  Kind is not a precise mapping to a URL. This can produce ambiguity
                            during interpretation and require a REST mapping.  In most cases, the dependency is on the group,resource tuple
                            and the version of the actual struct is irrelevant.
                         5. We cannot easily change it.  Because this type is embedded in many locations, updates to this type
                            will affect numerous schemas.  Don't make new APIs embed an underspecified API type they do not control.

                        Instead of using this type, create a locally provided and used type that is well-focused on your reference.
                        For example, ServiceReferences for admission registration: https://github.com/kubernetes/api/blob/release-1.17/admissionregistration/v1/types.go#L533 .

                        New uses of this type are discouraged because of difficulty describing its usage when embedded in APIs.
                         1. Ignored fields.  It includes many fields which are not generally honored.  For instance, ResourceVersion and FieldPath are both very rarely valid in actual usage.
                         2. Invalid usage help.  It is impossible to add specific help for individual usage.  In most embedded usages, there are particular
                            restrictions like, "must refer only to types A and B" or "UID not honored" or "name must be restricted".
                            Those cannot be well described when embedded.
                         3. Inconsistent validation.  Because the usages are different, the validation rules are different by usage, which makes it hard for users to predict what will happen.
                         4. The fields are both imprecise and overly precise.  Kind is not a precise mapping to a URL. This can produce ambiguity
                            during interpretation and require a REST mapping.  In most cases, the dependency is on the group,resource tuple
                            and the version of the actual struct is irrelevant.
                         5. We cannot easily change it.  Because this type is embedded in many locations, updates to this type
                            will affect numerous schemas.  Don't make new APIs embed an underspecified API type they do not control.

                        Instead of using this type, create a locally provided and used type that is well-focused on your reference.
                        For example, ServiceReferences for admission registration: https://github.com/kubernetes/api/blob/release-1.17/admissionregistration/v1/types.go#L533 .

                        fieldPath:
                          description: |-
                            If referring to a piece of an object instead of an entire object, this string
                            should contain a valid JSON/Go field access statement, such as desiredState.manifest.containers[2].
                            For example, if the object reference is to a container within a pod, this would take on a value like:
                            "spec.containers{name}" (where "name" refers to the name of the container that triggered
                            the event) or if no container name is specified "spec.containers[2]" (container with
                            index 2 in this pod). This syntax is chosen only to have some well-defined way of
                            referencing a part of an object.
                            TODO: this design is not final and this field is subject to change in the future.

                            Values is a map[string]string type that allows to define a set of key-value pairs.
                            These key-value pairs can optionally leverage Go templates for further processing.
                            With Sveltos, you can define key-value pairs where the values can be Go templates.
                            These templates have access to management cluster information during deployment. This allows
                            to do more than just replace placeholders. Variables can be used to dynamically
                            construct values based on other resources or variables within the Kustomize output.
                            For example, imagine you have a Region key with a template value like:
                            '{{ index .Cluster.metadata.labels "region" }}'.
                            This template retrieves the region label from the cluster instance metadata.
                            Finally, Sveltos uses these processed values to fill placeholders in the Kustomize output.
                            The output itself can also contain templates, like:
                            region: '{{ default "west" .Region }}'.
                            This way, the final output from Kustomize will have the region set dynamically based on
                            the actual region retrieved earlier.

                            it is possible to define key-value pairs. These key-value pairs can optionally leverage
                            Go templates for further processing.

                      Tier controls the order of deployment for ClusterProfile or Profile resources targeting
                      the same cluster resources.
                      Imagine two configurations (ClusterProfiles or Profiles) trying to deploy the same resource (a Kubernetes
                      resource or an helm chart). By default, the first one to reach the cluster "wins" and deploys it.
                      Tier allows you to override this. When conflicts arise, the ClusterProfile or Profile with the **lowest**
                      Tier value takes priority and deploys the resource.
                      Higher Tier values represent lower priority. The default Tier value is 100.
                      Using Tiers provides finer control over resource deployment within your cluster, particularly useful
                      when multiple configurations manage the same resources.

                        New uses of this type are discouraged because of difficulty describing its usage when embedded in APIs.
                         1. Ignored fields.  It includes many fields which are not generally honored.  For instance, ResourceVersion and FieldPath are both very rarely valid in actual usage.
                         2. Invalid usage help.  It is impossible to add specific help for individual usage.  In most embedded usages, there are particular
                            restrictions like, "must refer only to types A and B" or "UID not honored" or "name must be restricted".
                            Those cannot be well described when embedded.
                         3. Inconsistent validation.  Because the usages are different, the validation rules are different by usage, which makes it hard for users to predict what will happen.
                         4. The fields are both imprecise and overly precise.  Kind is not a precise mapping to a URL. This can produce ambiguity
                            during interpretation and require a REST mapping.  In most cases, the dependency is on the group,resource tuple
                            and the version of the actual struct is irrelevant.
                         5. We cannot easily change it.  Because this type is embedded in many locations, updates to this type
                            will affect numerous schemas.  Don't make new APIs embed an underspecified API type they do not control.

                        Instead of using this type, create a locally provided and used type that is well-focused on your reference.

                            If referring to a piece of an object instead of an entire object, this string
                            should contain a valid JSON/Go field access statement, such as desiredState.manifest.containers[2].
                            For example, if the object reference is to a container within a pod, this would take on a value like:
                            "spec.containers{name}" (where "name" refers to the name of the container that triggered
                            the event) or if no container name is specified "spec.containers[2]" (container with
                            index 2 in this pod). This syntax is chosen only to have some well-defined way of
                            referencing a part of an object.
                            TODO: this design is not final and this field is subject to change in the future.

                            Values is a map[string]string type that allows to define a set of key-value pairs.
                            These key-value pairs can optionally leverage Go templates for further processing.
                            With Sveltos, you can define key-value pairs where the values can be Go templates.
                            These templates have access to management cluster information during deployment. This allows
                            to do more than just replace placeholders. Variables can be used to dynamically
                            construct values based on other resources or variables within the Kustomize output.
                            For example, imagine you have a Region key with a template value like:
                            '{{ index .Cluster.metadata.labels "region" }}'.
                            This template retrieves the region label from the cluster instance metadata.
                            Finally, Sveltos uses these processed values to fill placeholders in the Kustomize output.
                            The output itself can also contain templates, like:
                            region: '{{ default "west" .Region }}'.
                            This way, the final output from Kustomize will have the region set dynamically based on
                            the actual region retrieved earlier.

                            it is possible to define key-value pairs. These key-value pairs can optionally leverage
                            Go templates for further processing.

                                For example, if the object reference is to a container within a pod, this would take on a value like:
                                "spec.containers{name}" (where "name" refers to the name of the container that triggered

                      Tier controls the order of deployment for ClusterProfile or Profile resources targeting
                      the same cluster resources.
                      Imagine two configurations (ClusterProfiles or Profiles) trying to deploy the same resource (a Kubernetes
                      resource or an helm chart). By default, the first one to reach the cluster "wins" and deploys it.
                      Tier allows you to override this. When conflicts arise, the ClusterProfile or Profile with the **lowest**
                      Tier value takes priority and deploys the resource.
                      Higher Tier values represent lower priority. The default Tier value is 100.
                      Using Tiers provides finer control over resource deployment within your cluster, particularly useful
                      when multiple configurations manage the same resources.

                        Values is a map[string]string type that allows to define a set of key-value pairs.
                        These key-value pairs can optionally leverage Go templates for further processing.
                        With Sveltos, you can define key-value pairs where the values can be Go templates.
                        These templates have access to management cluster information during deployment. This allows
                        to do more than just replace placeholders. Variables can be used to dynamically
                        construct values based on other resources or variables within the Kustomize output.
                        For example, imagine you have a Region key with a template value like:
                        '{{ index .Cluster.metadata.labels "region" }}'.
                        This template retrieves the region label from the cluster instance metadata.
                        Finally, Sveltos uses these processed values to fill placeholders in the Kustomize output.
                        The output itself can also contain templates, like:
                        region: '{{ default "west" .Region }}'.
                        This way, the final output from Kustomize will have the region set dynamically based on
                        the actual region retrieved earlier.

                  Tier controls the order of deployment for ClusterProfile or Profile resources targeting
                  the same cluster resources.
                  Imagine two configurations (ClusterProfiles or Profiles) trying to deploy the same resource (a Kubernetes
                  resource or an helm chart). By default, the first one to reach the cluster "wins" and deploys it.
                  Tier allows you to override this. When conflicts arise, the ClusterProfile or Profile with the **lowest**
                  Tier value takes priority and deploys the resource.
                  Higher Tier values represent lower priority. The default Tier value is 100.
                  Using Tiers provides finer control over resource deployment within your cluster, particularly useful
                  when multiple configurations manage the same resources.

                    New uses of this type are discouraged because of difficulty describing its usage when embedded in APIs.
                     1. Ignored fields.  It includes many fields which are not generally honored.  For instance, ResourceVersion and FieldPath are both very rarely valid in actual usage.
                     2. Invalid usage help.  It is impossible to add specific help for individual usage.  In most embedded usages, there are particular
                        restrictions like, "must refer only to types A and B" or "UID not honored" or "name must be restricted".
                        Those cannot be well described when embedded.
                     3. Inconsistent validation.  Because the usages are different, the validation rules are different by usage, which makes it hard for users to predict what will happen.
                     4. The fields are both imprecise and overly precise.  Kind is not a precise mapping to a URL. This can produce ambiguity
                        during interpretation and require a REST mapping.  In most cases, the dependency is on the group,resource tuple
                        and the version of the actual struct is irrelevant.
                     5. We cannot easily change it.  Because this type is embedded in many locations, updates to this type
                        will affect numerous schemas.  Don't make new APIs embed an underspecified API type they do not control.

                    Instead of using this type, create a locally provided and used type that is well-focused on your reference.

                        If referring to a piece of an object instead of an entire object, this string
                        should contain a valid JSON/Go field access statement, such as desiredState.manifest.containers[2].
                        For example, if the object reference is to a container within a pod, this would take on a value like:
                        "spec.containers{name}" (where "name" refers to the name of the container that triggered
                        the event) or if no container name is specified "spec.containers[2]" (container with

                      map is equivalent to an element of matchExpressions, whose key field is "key", the
                      operator is "In", and the values array contains only "value". The requirements are ANDed.

                        Values is a map[string]string type that allows to define a set of key-value pairs.
                        These key-value pairs can optionally leverage Go templates for further processing.
                        With Sveltos, you can define key-value pairs where the values can be Go templates.
                        These templates have access to management cluster information during deployment. This allows
                        to do more than just replace placeholders. Variables can be used to dynamically
                        construct values based on other resources or variables within the Kustomize output.
                        For example, imagine you have a Region key with a template value like:
                        '{{ index .Cluster.metadata.labels "region" }}'.
                        This template retrieves the region label from the cluster instance metadata.
                        Finally, Sveltos uses these processed values to fill placeholders in the Kustomize output.
                        The output itself can also contain templates, like:
                        region: '{{ default "west" .Region }}'.
                        This way, the final output from Kustomize will have the region set dynamically based on
                        the actual region retrieved earlier.

                  Tier controls the order of deployment for ClusterProfile or Profile resources targeting
                  the same cluster resources.
                  Imagine two configurations (ClusterProfiles or Profiles) trying to deploy the same resource (a Kubernetes
                  resource or an helm chart). By default, the first one to reach the cluster "wins" and deploys it.
                  Tier allows you to override this. When conflicts arise, the ClusterProfile or Profile with the **lowest**
                  Tier value takes priority and deploys the resource.
                  Higher Tier values represent lower priority. The default Tier value is 100.
                  Using Tiers provides finer control over resource deployment within your cluster, particularly useful
                  when multiple configurations manage the same resources.

                    New uses of this type are discouraged because of difficulty describing its usage when embedded in APIs.
                     1. Ignored fields.  It includes many fields which are not generally honored.  For instance, ResourceVersion and FieldPath are both very rarely valid in actual usage.
                     2. Invalid usage help.  It is impossible to add specific help for individual usage.  In most embedded usages, there are particular
                        restrictions like, "must refer only to types A and B" or "UID not honored" or "name must be restricted".
                        Those cannot be well described when embedded.
                     3. Inconsistent validation.  Because the usages are different, the validation rules are different by usage, which makes it hard for users to predict what will happen.
                     4. The fields are both imprecise and overly precise.  Kind is not a precise mapping to a URL. This can produce ambiguity
                        during interpretation and require a REST mapping.  In most cases, the dependency is on the group,resource tuple
                        and the version of the actual struct is irrelevant.
                     5. We cannot easily change it.  Because this type is embedded in many locations, updates to this type
                        will affect numerous schemas.  Don't make new APIs embed an underspecified API type they do not control.

                    Instead of using this type, create a locally provided and used type that is well-focused on your reference.

                        should contain a valid JSON/Go field access statement, such as desiredState.manifest.containers[2].
                        For example, if the object reference is to a container within a pod, this would take on a value like:
                        "spec.containers{name}" (where "name" refers to the name of the container that triggered

                        Values is a map[string]string type that allows to define a set of key-value pairs.
                        These key-value pairs can optionally leverage Go templates for further processing.
                        With Sveltos, you can define key-value pairs where the values can be Go templates.
                        These templates have access to management cluster information during deployment. This allows
                        to do more than just replace placeholders. Variables can be used to dynamically
                        construct values based on other resources or variables within the Kustomize output.
                        For example, imagine you have a Region key with a template value like:
                        '{{ index .Cluster.metadata.labels "region" }}'.
                        This template retrieves the region label from the cluster instance metadata.
                        Finally, Sveltos uses these processed values to fill placeholders in the Kustomize output.
                        The output itself can also contain templates, like:
                        region: '{{ default "west" .Region }}'.
                        This way, the final output from Kustomize will have the region set dynamically based on
                        the actual region retrieved earlier.

                  Tier controls the order of deployment for ClusterProfile or Profile resources targeting
                  the same cluster resources.
                  Imagine two configurations (ClusterProfiles or Profiles) trying to deploy the same resource (a Kubernetes
                  resource or an helm chart). By default, the first one to reach the cluster "wins" and deploys it.
                  Tier allows you to override this. When conflicts arise, the ClusterProfile or Profile with the **lowest**
                  Tier value takes priority and deploys the resource.
                  Higher Tier values represent lower priority. The default Tier value is 100.
                  Using Tiers provides finer control over resource deployment within your cluster, particularly useful
                  when multiple configurations manage the same resources.

                    New uses of this type are discouraged because of difficulty describing its usage when embedded in APIs.
                     1. Ignored fields.  It includes many fields which are not generally honored.  For instance, ResourceVersion and FieldPath are both very rarely valid in actual usage.
                     2. Invalid usage help.  It is impossible to add specific help for individual usage.  In most embedded usages, there are particular
                        restrictions like, "must refer only to types A and B" or "UID not honored" or "name must be restricted".
                        Those cannot be well described when embedded.
                     3. Inconsistent validation.  Because the usages are different, the validation rules are different by usage, which makes it hard for users to predict what will happen.
                     4. The fields are both imprecise and overly precise.  Kind is not a precise mapping to a URL. This can produce ambiguity
                        during interpretation and require a REST mapping.  In most cases, the dependency is on the group,resource tuple
                        and the version of the actual struct is irrelevant.
                     5. We cannot easily change it.  Because this type is embedded in many locations, updates to this type
                        will affect numerous schemas.  Don't make new APIs embed an underspecified API type they do not control.

                    Instead of using this type, create a locally provided and used type that is well-focused on your reference.

                        should contain a valid JSON/Go field access statement, such as desiredState.manifest.containers[2].
                        For example, if the object reference is to a container within a pod, this would take on a value like:
                        "spec.containers{name}" (where "name" refers to the name of the container that triggered
                        the event) or if no container name is specified "spec.containers[2]" (container with

                        New uses of this type are discouraged because of difficulty describing its usage when embedded in APIs.
                         1. Ignored fields.  It includes many fields which are not generally honored.  For instance, ResourceVersion and FieldPath are both very rarely valid in actual usage.
                         2. Invalid usage help.  It is impossible to add specific help for individual usage.  In most embedded usages, there are particular
                            restrictions like, "must refer only to types A and B" or "UID not honored" or "name must be restricted".
                            Those cannot be well described when embedded.
                         3. Inconsistent validation.  Because the usages are different, the validation rules are different by usage, which makes it hard for users to predict what will happen.
                         4. The fields are both imprecise and overly precise.  Kind is not a precise mapping to a URL. This can produce ambiguity
                            during interpretation and require a REST mapping.  In most cases, the dependency is on the group,resource tuple
                            and the version of the actual struct is irrelevant.
                         5. We cannot easily change it.  Because this type is embedded in many locations, updates to this type
                            will affect numerous schemas.  Don't make new APIs embed an underspecified API type they do not control.

                        Instead of using this type, create a locally provided and used type that is well-focused on your reference.
                        For example, ServiceReferences for admission registration: https://github.com/kubernetes/api/blob/release-1.17/admissionregistration/v1/types.go#L533 .

                            For example, if the object reference is to a container within a pod, this would take on a value like:
                            "spec.containers{name}" (where "name" refers to the name of the container that triggered

                        Values is a map[string]string type that allows to define a set of key-value pairs.
                        These key-value pairs can optionally leverage Go templates for further processing.
                        With Sveltos, you can define key-value pairs where the values can be Go templates.
                        These templates have access to management cluster information during deployment. This allows
                        to do more than just replace placeholders. Variables can be used to dynamically
                        construct values based on other resources or variables within the Kustomize output.
                        For example, imagine you have a Region key with a template value like:
                        '{{ index .Cluster.metadata.labels "region" }}'.
                        This template retrieves the region label from the cluster instance metadata.
                        Finally, Sveltos uses these processed values to fill placeholders in the Kustomize output.
                        The output itself can also contain templates, like:
                        region: '{{ default "west" .Region }}'.
                        This way, the final output from Kustomize will have the region set dynamically based on
                        the actual region retrieved earlier.

                  Tier controls the order of deployment for ClusterProfile or Profile resources targeting

                  Imagine two configurations (ClusterProfiles or Profiles) trying to deploy the same resource (a Kubernetes
                  resource or an helm chart). By default, the first one to reach the cluster "wins" and deploys it.
                  Tier allows you to override this. When conflicts arise, the ClusterProfile or Profile with the **lowest**
                  Tier value takes priority and deploys the resource.
                  Higher Tier values represent lower priority. The default Tier value is 100.
                  Using Tiers provides finer control over resource deployment within your cluster, particularly useful
                  when multiple configurations manage the same resources.

                    New uses of this type are discouraged because of difficulty describing its usage when embedded in APIs.
                     1. Ignored fields.  It includes many fields which are not generally honored.  For instance, ResourceVersion and FieldPath are both very rarely valid in actual usage.
                     2. Invalid usage help.  It is impossible to add specific help for individual usage.  In most embedded usages, there are particular
                        restrictions like, "must refer only to types A and B" or "UID not honored" or "name must be restricted".
                        Those cannot be well described when embedded.
                     3. Inconsistent validation.  Because the usages are different, the validation rules are different by usage, which makes it hard for users to predict what will happen.
                     4. The fields are both imprecise and overly precise.  Kind is not a precise mapping to a URL. This can produce ambiguity
                        during interpretation and require a REST mapping.  In most cases, the dependency is on the group,resource tuple
                        and the version of the actual struct is irrelevant.
                     5. We cannot easily change it.  Because this type is embedded in many locations, updates to this type
                        will affect numerous schemas.  Don't make new APIs embed an underspecified API type they do not control.

                    Instead of using this type, create a locally provided and used type that is well-focused on your reference.

                        New uses of this type are discouraged because of difficulty describing its usage when embedded in APIs.
                         1. Ignored fields.  It includes many fields which are not generally honored.  For instance, ResourceVersion and FieldPath are both very rarely valid in actual usage.
                         2. Invalid usage help.  It is impossible to add specific help for individual usage.  In most embedded usages, there are particular
                            restrictions like, "must refer only to types A and B" or "UID not honored" or "name must be restricted".
                            Those cannot be well described when embedded.
                         3. Inconsistent validation.  Because the usages are different, the validation rules are different by usage, which makes it hard for users to predict what will happen.
                         4. The fields are both imprecise and overly precise.  Kind is not a precise mapping to a URL. This can produce ambiguity
                            during interpretation and require a REST mapping.  In most cases, the dependency is on the group,resource tuple
                            and the version of the actual struct is irrelevant.
                         5. We cannot easily change it.  Because this type is embedded in many locations, updates to this type
                            will affect numerous schemas.  Don't make new APIs embed an underspecified API type they do not control.

                        Instead of using this type, create a locally provided and used type that is well-focused on your reference.
                        For example, ServiceReferences for admission registration: https://github.com/kubernetes/api/blob/release-1.17/admissionregistration/v1/types.go#L533 .

                          description: API version of the referent.

                        fieldPath:
                          description: |-
                            If referring to a piece of an object instead of an entire object, this string
                            should contain a valid JSON/Go field access statement, such as desiredState.manifest.containers[2].
                            For example, if the object reference is to a container within a pod, this would take on a value like:
                            "spec.containers{name}" (where "name" refers to the name of the container that triggered
                            the event) or if no container name is specified "spec.containers[2]" (container with
                            index 2 in this pod). This syntax is chosen only to have some well-defined way of
                            referencing a part of an object.
