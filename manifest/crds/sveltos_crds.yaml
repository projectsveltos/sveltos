                  Tier controls the order of deployment for ClusterProfile or Profile resources targeting

                  Imagine two configurations (ClusterProfiles or Profiles) trying to deploy the same resource (a Kubernetes
                  resource or an helm chart). By default, the first one to reach the cluster "wins" and deploys it.
                  Tier allows you to override this. When conflicts arise, the ClusterProfile or Profile with the **lowest**
                  Tier value takes priority and deploys the resource.
                  Higher Tier values represent lower priority. The default Tier value is 100.
                  Using Tiers provides finer control over resource deployment within your cluster, particularly useful
                  when multiple configurations manage the same resources.

                  When a value is specified, the referenced Kubernetes Secret object must exist,
                  and will be used to connect to the Kubernetes cluster.

                                                Examples:
                                                  - HTTP Repository: https://charts.example.com/stable

                                                  - Any other valid URL where Helm charts are hosted.

                                                Alternatively, it can be a Flux source reference:
                                                  <flux source kind>://<flux source namespace>/<flux source name>/<path>

                                                  - <flux source kind> is the type of Flux source (gitrepository, ocirepository, bucket).
                                                  - <flux source namespace> and <flux source name> are the namespace and name of the Flux Source in the management cluster.
                                                  - <path> is the path within the source repository where the Helm charts are located.

                                                For instance:
                                                  gitrepository://flux-system/flux-system/charts/projectsveltos

                                                Assuming there is a Flux GitRepository named 'flux-system' in the 'flux-system' namespace
                                                syncing 'https://github.com/projectsveltos/helm-charts.git/', and the Helm charts are
                                                located in the 'charts/projectsveltos' directory of that repository.

                                                Values is a map[string]string type that allows to define a set of key-value pairs.
                                                These key-value pairs can optionally leverage Go templates for further processing.
                                                With Sveltos, you can define key-value pairs where the values can be Go templates.
                                                These templates have access to management cluster information during deployment. This allows
                                                to do more than just replace placeholders. Variables can be used to dynamically
                                                construct values based on other resources or variables within the Kustomize output.
                                                For example, imagine you have a Region key with a template value like:
                                                '{{ index .Cluster.metadata.labels "region" }}'.
                                                This template retrieves the region label from the cluster instance metadata.
                                                Finally, Sveltos uses these processed values to fill placeholders in the Kustomize output.
                                                The output itself can also contain templates, like:
                                                region: '{{ default "west" .Region }}'.
                                                This way, the final output from Kustomize will have the region set dynamically based on
                                                the actual region retrieved earlier.

                                                ValuesFrom can reference ConfigMap/Secret instances. Within the ConfigMap or Secret data,
                                                it is possible to define key-value pairs. These key-value pairs can optionally leverage
                                                Go templates for further processing.
                                                With Sveltos, you can define key-value pairs where the values can be Go templates.
                                                These templates have access to management cluster information during deployment. This allows
                                                to do more than just replace placeholders. Variables can be used to dynamically
                                                construct values based on other resources or variables within the Kustomize output.
                                                For example, imagine you have a Region key with a template value like:
                                                '{{ index .Cluster.metadata.labels "region" }}'.
                                                This template retrieves the region label from the cluster instance metadata.
                                                Finally, Sveltos uses these processed values to fill placeholders in the Kustomize output.
                                                The output itself can also contain templates, like:
                                                region: '{{ default "west" .Region }}'.
                                                This way, the final output from Kustomize will have the region set dynamically based on
                                                the actual region retrieved earlier.

                                    Tier controls the order of deployment for ClusterProfile or Profile resources targeting
                                    the same cluster resources.
                                    Imagine two configurations (ClusterProfiles or Profiles) trying to deploy the same resource (a Kubernetes
                                    resource or an helm chart). By default, the first one to reach the cluster "wins" and deploys it.
                                    Tier allows you to override this. When conflicts arise, the ClusterProfile or Profile with the **lowest**
                                    Tier value takes priority and deploys the resource.
                                    Higher Tier values represent lower priority. The default Tier value is 100.
                                    Using Tiers provides finer control over resource deployment within your cluster, particularly useful
                                    when multiple configurations manage the same resources.

                                                        Examples:
                                                          - HTTP Repository: https://charts.example.com/stable

                                                        Alternatively, it can be a Flux source reference:

                                                        Where:
                                                          - <flux source kind> is the type of Flux source (gitrepository, ocirepository, bucket).
                                                          - <flux source namespace> and <flux source name> are the namespace and name of the Flux Source in the management cluster.
                                                          - <path> is the path within the source repository where the Helm charts are located.

                                                        For instance:
                                                          gitrepository://flux-system/flux-system/charts/projectsveltos

                                                        Assuming there is a Flux GitRepository named 'flux-system' in the 'flux-system' namespace

                                                        Values is a map[string]string type that allows to define a set of key-value pairs.
                                                        These key-value pairs can optionally leverage Go templates for further processing.
                                                        With Sveltos, you can define key-value pairs where the values can be Go templates.
                                                        These templates have access to management cluster information during deployment. This allows
                                                        to do more than just replace placeholders. Variables can be used to dynamically
                                                        construct values based on other resources or variables within the Kustomize output.
                                                        For example, imagine you have a Region key with a template value like:
                                                        '{{ index .Cluster.metadata.labels "region" }}'.
                                                        This template retrieves the region label from the cluster instance metadata.
                                                        Finally, Sveltos uses these processed values to fill placeholders in the Kustomize output.
                                                        The output itself can also contain templates, like:
                                                        region: '{{ default "west" .Region }}'.
                                                        This way, the final output from Kustomize will have the region set dynamically based on
                                                        the actual region retrieved earlier.
                                                    type: object
                                                valuesFrom:
                                                    description: |-
                                                        ValuesFrom can reference ConfigMap/Secret instances. Within the ConfigMap or Secret data,
                                                        it is possible to define key-value pairs. These key-value pairs can optionally leverage
                                                        Go templates for further processing.
                                                        With Sveltos, you can define key-value pairs where the values can be Go templates.
                                                        These templates have access to management cluster information during deployment. This allows
                                                        to do more than just replace placeholders. Variables can be used to dynamically
                                                        construct values based on other resources or variables within the Kustomize output.
                                                        For example, imagine you have a Region key with a template value like:
                                                        '{{ index .Cluster.metadata.labels "region" }}'.
                                                        This template retrieves the region label from the cluster instance metadata.
                                                        Finally, Sveltos uses these processed values to fill placeholders in the Kustomize output.
                                                        The output itself can also contain templates, like:
                                                        region: '{{ default "west" .Region }}'.
                                                        This way, the final output from Kustomize will have the region set dynamically based on
                                                        the actual region retrieved earlier.

                                            Tier controls the order of deployment for ClusterProfile or Profile resources targeting
                                            the same cluster resources.
                                            Imagine two configurations (ClusterProfiles or Profiles) trying to deploy the same resource (a Kubernetes
                                            resource or an helm chart). By default, the first one to reach the cluster "wins" and deploys it.
                                            Tier allows you to override this. When conflicts arise, the ClusterProfile or Profile with the **lowest**
                                            Tier value takes priority and deploys the resource.
                                            Higher Tier values represent lower priority. The default Tier value is 100.
                                            Using Tiers provides finer control over resource deployment within your cluster, particularly useful
                                            when multiple configurations manage the same resources.

                                                Examples:
                                                  - HTTP Repository: https://charts.example.com/stable

                                                  - GitHub Pages: https://<username>.github.io/<repository>/
                                                  - Any other valid URL where Helm charts are hosted.

                                                Alternatively, it can be a Flux source reference:
                                                  <flux source kind>://<flux source namespace>/<flux source name>/<path>

                                                  - <flux source kind> is the type of Flux source (gitrepository, ocirepository, bucket).
                                                  - <flux source namespace> and <flux source name> are the namespace and name of the Flux Source in the management cluster.
                                                  - <path> is the path within the source repository where the Helm charts are located.

                                                For instance:
                                                  gitrepository://flux-system/flux-system/charts/projectsveltos

                                                Assuming there is a Flux GitRepository named 'flux-system' in the 'flux-system' namespace
                                                syncing 'https://github.com/projectsveltos/helm-charts.git/', and the Helm charts are
                                                located in the 'charts/projectsveltos' directory of that repository.

                                                Values is a map[string]string type that allows to define a set of key-value pairs.
                                                These key-value pairs can optionally leverage Go templates for further processing.
                                                With Sveltos, you can define key-value pairs where the values can be Go templates.
                                                These templates have access to management cluster information during deployment. This allows
                                                to do more than just replace placeholders. Variables can be used to dynamically
                                                construct values based on other resources or variables within the Kustomize output.
                                                For example, imagine you have a Region key with a template value like:
                                                '{{ index .Cluster.metadata.labels "region" }}'.
                                                This template retrieves the region label from the cluster instance metadata.
                                                Finally, Sveltos uses these processed values to fill placeholders in the Kustomize output.
                                                The output itself can also contain templates, like:
                                                region: '{{ default "west" .Region }}'.
                                                This way, the final output from Kustomize will have the region set dynamically based on
                                                the actual region retrieved earlier.

                                                ValuesFrom can reference ConfigMap/Secret instances. Within the ConfigMap or Secret data,
                                                it is possible to define key-value pairs. These key-value pairs can optionally leverage
                                                Go templates for further processing.
                                                With Sveltos, you can define key-value pairs where the values can be Go templates.
                                                These templates have access to management cluster information during deployment. This allows
                                                to do more than just replace placeholders. Variables can be used to dynamically
                                                construct values based on other resources or variables within the Kustomize output.
                                                For example, imagine you have a Region key with a template value like:
                                                '{{ index .Cluster.metadata.labels "region" }}'.
                                                This template retrieves the region label from the cluster instance metadata.
                                                Finally, Sveltos uses these processed values to fill placeholders in the Kustomize output.
                                                The output itself can also contain templates, like:
                                                region: '{{ default "west" .Region }}'.
                                                This way, the final output from Kustomize will have the region set dynamically based on
                                                the actual region retrieved earlier.

                                    the same cluster resources.
                                    Imagine two configurations (ClusterProfiles or Profiles) trying to deploy the same resource (a Kubernetes
                                    resource or an helm chart). By default, the first one to reach the cluster "wins" and deploys it.
                                    Tier allows you to override this. When conflicts arise, the ClusterProfile or Profile with the **lowest**
                                    Tier value takes priority and deploys the resource.
                                    Higher Tier values represent lower priority. The default Tier value is 100.
                                    Using Tiers provides finer control over resource deployment within your cluster, particularly useful
                                    when multiple configurations manage the same resources.

                                                Examples:

                                                  - Any other valid URL where Helm charts are hosted.

                                                  - <flux source kind> is the type of Flux source (gitrepository, ocirepository, bucket).
                                                  - <flux source namespace> and <flux source name> are the namespace and name of the Flux Source in the management cluster.

                                                Values is a map[string]string type that allows to define a set of key-value pairs.
                                                These key-value pairs can optionally leverage Go templates for further processing.
                                                With Sveltos, you can define key-value pairs where the values can be Go templates.
                                                These templates have access to management cluster information during deployment. This allows
                                                to do more than just replace placeholders. Variables can be used to dynamically
                                                construct values based on other resources or variables within the Kustomize output.
                                                For example, imagine you have a Region key with a template value like:
                                                '{{ index .Cluster.metadata.labels "region" }}'.
                                                This template retrieves the region label from the cluster instance metadata.
                                                Finally, Sveltos uses these processed values to fill placeholders in the Kustomize output.
                                                The output itself can also contain templates, like:
                                                region: '{{ default "west" .Region }}'.
                                                This way, the final output from Kustomize will have the region set dynamically based on
                                                the actual region retrieved earlier.

                                                it is possible to define key-value pairs. These key-value pairs can optionally leverage
                                                Go templates for further processing.

                                                        "spec.containers{name}" (where "name" refers to the name of the container that triggered
                                                        the event) or if no container name is specified "spec.containers[2]" (container with
                                                        index 2 in this pod). This syntax is chosen only to have some well-defined way of
                                                        referencing a part of an object.

                                    Tier controls the order of deployment for ClusterProfile or Profile resources targeting
                                    the same cluster resources.
                                    Imagine two configurations (ClusterProfiles or Profiles) trying to deploy the same resource (a Kubernetes
                                    resource or an helm chart). By default, the first one to reach the cluster "wins" and deploys it.
                                    Tier allows you to override this. When conflicts arise, the ClusterProfile or Profile with the **lowest**
                                    Tier value takes priority and deploys the resource.
                                    Higher Tier values represent lower priority. The default Tier value is 100.
                                    Using Tiers provides finer control over resource deployment within your cluster, particularly useful
                                    when multiple configurations manage the same resources.
