                    type are discouraged because of difficulty describing its usage
                    when embedded in APIs. 1. Ignored fields.  It includes many fields
                    which are not generally honored.  For instance, ResourceVersion
                    and FieldPath are both very rarely valid in actual usage. 2. Invalid
                    usage help.  It is impossible to add specific help for individual
                    usage.  In most embedded usages, there are particular restrictions
                    like, \"must refer only to types A and B\" or \"UID not honored\"
                    or \"name must be restricted\". Those cannot be well described
                    when embedded. 3. Inconsistent validation.  Because the usages
                    are different, the validation rules are different by usage, which
                    makes it hard for users to predict what will happen. 4. The fields
                    are both imprecise and overly precise.  Kind is not a precise
                    mapping to a URL. This can produce ambiguity during interpretation
                    and require a REST mapping.  In most cases, the dependency is
                    on the group,resource tuple and the version of the actual struct
                    is irrelevant. 5. We cannot easily change it.  Because this type
                    is embedded in many locations, updates to this type will affect
                    numerous schemas.  Don't make new APIs embed an underspecified
                    API type they do not control. \n Instead of using this type, create
                    a locally provided and used type that is well-focused on your
                    reference. For example, ServiceReferences for admission registration:

                    you inspect or modify the referred object. --- New uses of this
                    type are discouraged because of difficulty describing its usage
                    when embedded in APIs. 1. Ignored fields.  It includes many fields
                    which are not generally honored.  For instance, ResourceVersion
                    and FieldPath are both very rarely valid in actual usage. 2. Invalid
                    usage help.  It is impossible to add specific help for individual
                    usage.  In most embedded usages, there are particular restrictions
                    like, \"must refer only to types A and B\" or \"UID not honored\"
                    or \"name must be restricted\". Those cannot be well described
                    when embedded. 3. Inconsistent validation.  Because the usages
                    are different, the validation rules are different by usage, which
                    makes it hard for users to predict what will happen. 4. The fields
                    are both imprecise and overly precise.  Kind is not a precise
                    mapping to a URL. This can produce ambiguity during interpretation
                    and require a REST mapping.  In most cases, the dependency is
                    on the group,resource tuple and the version of the actual struct
                    is irrelevant. 5. We cannot easily change it.  Because this type
                    is embedded in many locations, updates to this type will affect
                    numerous schemas.  Don't make new APIs embed an underspecified
                    API type they do not control. \n Instead of using this type, create
                    a locally provided and used type that is well-focused on your
                    reference. For example, ServiceReferences for admission registration:
                    https://github.com/kubernetes/api/blob/release-1.17/admissionregistration/v1/types.go#L533
                    ."

                        an entire object, this string should contain a valid JSON/Go
                        field access statement, such as desiredState.manifest.containers[2].
                        For example, if the object reference is to a container within
                        a pod, this would take on a value like: "spec.containers{name}"
                        (where "name" refers to the name of the container that triggered
                        the event) or if no container name is specified "spec.containers[2]"

                        an object. TODO: this design is not final and this field is

                    type are discouraged because of difficulty describing its usage
                    when embedded in APIs. 1. Ignored fields.  It includes many fields
                    which are not generally honored.  For instance, ResourceVersion
                    and FieldPath are both very rarely valid in actual usage. 2. Invalid
                    usage help.  It is impossible to add specific help for individual
                    usage.  In most embedded usages, there are particular restrictions
                    like, \"must refer only to types A and B\" or \"UID not honored\"
                    or \"name must be restricted\". Those cannot be well described
                    when embedded. 3. Inconsistent validation.  Because the usages
                    are different, the validation rules are different by usage, which
                    makes it hard for users to predict what will happen. 4. The fields
                    are both imprecise and overly precise.  Kind is not a precise
                    mapping to a URL. This can produce ambiguity during interpretation
                    and require a REST mapping.  In most cases, the dependency is
                    on the group,resource tuple and the version of the actual struct
                    is irrelevant. 5. We cannot easily change it.  Because this type
                    is embedded in many locations, updates to this type will affect
                    numerous schemas.  Don't make new APIs embed an underspecified
                    API type they do not control. \n Instead of using this type, create
                    a locally provided and used type that is well-focused on your
                    reference. For example, ServiceReferences for admission registration:

                  description: "ObjectReference contains enough information to let
                    you inspect or modify the referred object. --- New uses of this
                    type are discouraged because of difficulty describing its usage
                    when embedded in APIs. 1. Ignored fields.  It includes many fields
                    which are not generally honored.  For instance, ResourceVersion
                    and FieldPath are both very rarely valid in actual usage. 2. Invalid
                    usage help.  It is impossible to add specific help for individual
                    usage.  In most embedded usages, there are particular restrictions
                    like, \"must refer only to types A and B\" or \"UID not honored\"
                    or \"name must be restricted\". Those cannot be well described
                    when embedded. 3. Inconsistent validation.  Because the usages
                    are different, the validation rules are different by usage, which
                    makes it hard for users to predict what will happen. 4. The fields
                    are both imprecise and overly precise.  Kind is not a precise
                    mapping to a URL. This can produce ambiguity during interpretation
                    and require a REST mapping.  In most cases, the dependency is
                    on the group,resource tuple and the version of the actual struct
                    is irrelevant. 5. We cannot easily change it.  Because this type
                    is embedded in many locations, updates to this type will affect
                    numerous schemas.  Don't make new APIs embed an underspecified
                    API type they do not control. \n Instead of using this type, create
                    a locally provided and used type that is well-focused on your
                    reference. For example, ServiceReferences for admission registration:

                    type are discouraged because of difficulty describing its usage
                    when embedded in APIs. 1. Ignored fields.  It includes many fields
                    which are not generally honored.  For instance, ResourceVersion
                    and FieldPath are both very rarely valid in actual usage. 2. Invalid
                    usage help.  It is impossible to add specific help for individual
                    usage.  In most embedded usages, there are particular restrictions
                    like, \"must refer only to types A and B\" or \"UID not honored\"
                    or \"name must be restricted\". Those cannot be well described
                    when embedded. 3. Inconsistent validation.  Because the usages
                    are different, the validation rules are different by usage, which
                    makes it hard for users to predict what will happen. 4. The fields
                    are both imprecise and overly precise.  Kind is not a precise
                    mapping to a URL. This can produce ambiguity during interpretation
                    and require a REST mapping.  In most cases, the dependency is
                    on the group,resource tuple and the version of the actual struct
                    is irrelevant. 5. We cannot easily change it.  Because this type
                    is embedded in many locations, updates to this type will affect
                    numerous schemas.  Don't make new APIs embed an underspecified
                    API type they do not control. \n Instead of using this type, create
                    a locally provided and used type that is well-focused on your
                    reference. For example, ServiceReferences for admission registration:
                    https://github.com/kubernetes/api/blob/release-1.17/admissionregistration/v1/types.go#L533

                        of this type are discouraged because of difficulty describing
                        its usage when embedded in APIs. 1. Ignored fields.  It includes
                        many fields which are not generally honored.  For instance,
                        ResourceVersion and FieldPath are both very rarely valid in
                        actual usage. 2. Invalid usage help.  It is impossible to
                        add specific help for individual usage.  In most embedded
                        usages, there are particular restrictions like, \"must refer
                        only to types A and B\" or \"UID not honored\" or \"name must
                        be restricted\". Those cannot be well described when embedded.
                        3. Inconsistent validation.  Because the usages are different,
                        the validation rules are different by usage, which makes it
                        hard for users to predict what will happen. 4. The fields
                        are both imprecise and overly precise.  Kind is not a precise
                        mapping to a URL. This can produce ambiguity during interpretation
                        and require a REST mapping.  In most cases, the dependency
                        is on the group,resource tuple and the version of the actual
                        struct is irrelevant. 5. We cannot easily change it.  Because
                        this type is embedded in many locations, updates to this type
                        will affect numerous schemas.  Don't make new APIs embed an
                        underspecified API type they do not control. \n Instead of
                        using this type, create a locally provided and used type that
                        is well-focused on your reference. For example, ServiceReferences

                    type are discouraged because of difficulty describing its usage
                    when embedded in APIs. 1. Ignored fields.  It includes many fields
                    which are not generally honored.  For instance, ResourceVersion
                    and FieldPath are both very rarely valid in actual usage. 2. Invalid
                    usage help.  It is impossible to add specific help for individual
                    usage.  In most embedded usages, there are particular restrictions
                    like, \"must refer only to types A and B\" or \"UID not honored\"
                    or \"name must be restricted\". Those cannot be well described
                    when embedded. 3. Inconsistent validation.  Because the usages
                    are different, the validation rules are different by usage, which
                    makes it hard for users to predict what will happen. 4. The fields
                    are both imprecise and overly precise.  Kind is not a precise
                    mapping to a URL. This can produce ambiguity during interpretation
                    and require a REST mapping.  In most cases, the dependency is
                    on the group,resource tuple and the version of the actual struct
                    is irrelevant. 5. We cannot easily change it.  Because this type
                    is embedded in many locations, updates to this type will affect
                    numerous schemas.  Don't make new APIs embed an underspecified

                  description: "ObjectReference contains enough information to let
                    you inspect or modify the referred object. --- New uses of this
                    type are discouraged because of difficulty describing its usage
                    when embedded in APIs. 1. Ignored fields.  It includes many fields
                    which are not generally honored.  For instance, ResourceVersion
                    and FieldPath are both very rarely valid in actual usage. 2. Invalid
                    usage help.  It is impossible to add specific help for individual
                    usage.  In most embedded usages, there are particular restrictions
                    like, \"must refer only to types A and B\" or \"UID not honored\"
                    or \"name must be restricted\". Those cannot be well described
                    when embedded. 3. Inconsistent validation.  Because the usages
                    are different, the validation rules are different by usage, which
                    makes it hard for users to predict what will happen. 4. The fields
                    are both imprecise and overly precise.  Kind is not a precise
                    mapping to a URL. This can produce ambiguity during interpretation
                    and require a REST mapping.  In most cases, the dependency is
                    on the group,resource tuple and the version of the actual struct
                    is irrelevant. 5. We cannot easily change it.  Because this type
                    is embedded in many locations, updates to this type will affect
                    numerous schemas.  Don't make new APIs embed an underspecified
                    API type they do not control. \n Instead of using this type, create
                    a locally provided and used type that is well-focused on your
                    reference. For example, ServiceReferences for admission registration:
                    https://github.com/kubernetes/api/blob/release-1.17/admissionregistration/v1/types.go#L533

    # leaderElectionReleaseOnCancel defines if the leader should step down volume
    # when the Manager ends. This requires the binary to immediately end when the
    # Manager is stopped, otherwise, this setting is unsafe. Setting this significantly
    # speeds up voluntary leader transitions as the new leader don't have to wait
    # LeaseDuration time first.
    # In the default scaffold provided, the program ends immediately after
    # the manager stops, so would be fine to enable this option. However,
    # if you are doing or is intended to do any operation such as perform cleanups
    # after the manager stops then its usage might be unsafe.
