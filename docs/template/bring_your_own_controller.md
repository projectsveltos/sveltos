In the example below, we will guide you through the process of extending Sveltos with your own controller. The example focuses on extending Sveltos by the use of a new controller that allocates a storage bucket from Google Cloud, followed by Sveltos deploying a pod in the managed cluster to upload a file to that bucket, all using a single YAML configuration.

If you are new to Sveltos, please go through the [deploy Kubernetes add-ons](../addons/addons.md) and the [Sveltos events](../events/addon_event_deployment.md) resources before proceeding.

## Deploy Sveltos in the management cluster

Our management cluster is a Kind cluster running on a laptop. To deploy Sveltos on the management cluster, follow the steps described in the [instructions](../getting_started/install/install.md) documentation.

```bash
$ kubectl get pods -n projectsveltos

NAME                                  READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
access-manager-69d7fd69fc-7mm2p       2/2     Running   0          3m58s

```

## Google Cloud Storage Buckets

When a new production cluster is created, we want to dynamically create a Google Bucket for it and grant a service account permissions to upload files to it. To automate the process, and demo Sveltos extensions, we developed a controller that can create and delete Google Storage Buckets as instructed. You can find this controller on [Github](https://github.com/gianlucam76/gcs-storage-operator).

The controller is responsible for managing instances of CRD `bucket.v1alpha1.demo.projectsveltos.io`, creating a Bucket on Google Cloud Storage, and granting service accounts the `objectCreator` permission on it.

To deploy the controller in the management cluster, please refer to the instructions in the [README](https://github.com/gianlucam76/gcs-storage-operator/blob/main/README.md) as you need to fetch some information from Google Cloud in order to give the controller permission to create buckets on Google Cloud Storage.

## Instruct Sveltos

Before posting the necessary Sveltos ClusterProfile, we need to grant Sveltos permission to create bucket instance in the management clusters.

```bash
$ kubectl edit clusterrole addon-controller-role-extra
```

and edit rules by adding

```yaml
rules:
- apiGroups:
  - storage.gcp.upbound.io
  resources:
  - buckets
  verbs:
  - "*"
```

The following YAML instructions are used to deploy add-ons using Sveltos:

1. The content of the ConfigMap `bucket` in the `default` namespace is deployed by Sveltos on the management cluster (`deploymentType: Local`). The contents of this ConfigMap is an instance of the `Bucket` CRD, which is expressed as a template. Before deploying it to the management cluster, Sveltos instantiates the template by setting the namespace to be the same as the namespace of the managed cluster where Sveltos deploys add-ons defined in this ClusterProfile.

2. The content of the ConfigMap `uploader` in the `default` namespace is deployed by Sveltos on the managed cluster (`deploymentType: Remote`). The contents of this ConfigMap is a Pod instance expressed as a template. Sveltos instantiates the template using information from the bucket instance created in the previous step. This Pod then uploads a file to the newly created bucket on Google Cloud Storage.

        args:
          - "-c"
          - |
            echo "Hello world" > /tmp/hello.txt
            gcloud auth activate-service-account --key-file=/var/run/secrets/cloud.google.com/service-account.json
            gsutil cp /tmp/hello.txt gs://{{ (index .MgtmResources "Bucket").spec.bucketName }}
        volumeMounts:
          - name: gcp-sa
            mountPath: /var/run/secrets/cloud.google.com/
            readOnly: true
      volumes:
        - name: gcp-sa
          secret:
            secretName: gcs-credentials
```

After posting it a Bucket instance is created in the management cluster by Sveltos. 

```bash
$ kubectl get bucket -A

NAMESPACE   NAME                  BUCKET NAME                                BUCKET URL
default     sveltos-demo-bucket   sveltos-demo-sveltos-management-workload   https://storage.googleapis.com/sveltos-demo-sveltos-management-workload
```

The gcs-storage-controller processes this instance and creates a bucket on Google Cloud Storage.

![Google Cloud Storage Bucket](../assets/google_cloud_storage_bucket.png)

To verify the bucket has been created on Google Cloud Storage 

```
$ gsutil iam get gs://<BUCKET NAME>
```

Sveltos has also deployed a Pod in the managed cluster and has passed this Pod with a secret containing the credentials to access the bucket (this information was provided to Sveltos by the gcs controller we developed). This pod has then uploaded a file to the Google Storage Bucket just created.

## Summary

The example focused on demostating how easy is to extend Sveltos. We focused on using a new controller that allocates a storage bucket from Google Cloud and deploy a pod in the managed cluster to upload a file to that bucket, all using a single YAML configuration.

Whenever you need to generate extra information and pass it along to the managed cluster, using the scheme mentioned above you can extend Sveltos by writing your own controller.
