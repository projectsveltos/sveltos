## What is Projectsveltos

Sveltos is a set of Kubernetes controllers deployed in the management cluster. From the management cluster, Sveltos can manage add-ons and applications in multiple clusters.

## Installation

### Mode 1: Agent Installation Managed Cluster

To install Sveltos, run the following commands:

```
$ kubectl apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/projectsveltos/sveltos/main/manifest/manifest.yaml

$ kubectl apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/projectsveltos/sveltos/main/manifest/default-classifier.yaml
```

In this mode, Sveltos will deploy up to two agents, *sveltos-agent* and *drift-detection-manager*[^1], in each **managed clusters**.

### Mode 2: Agentless Installation Managed Cluster

If you do not want to have any Sveltos agent in any **managed cluster**, run the following commands:

```
$ kubectl apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/projectsveltos/sveltos/main/manifest/agents_in_mgmt_cluster_manifest.yaml

$ kubectl apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/projectsveltos/sveltos/main/manifest/default-classifier.yaml
```

In this mode, Sveltos agents will be created, per managed cluster, in the management cluster itself[^2].

Sveltos uses the git-flow branching model. The base branch is dev. If you are looking for latest features, please use the dev branch. If you are looking for a stable version, please use the main branch or tags labeled as v0.x.x.

## Helm Installation

```
$ helm repo add projectsveltos https://projectsveltos.github.io/helm-charts

$ helm install projectsveltos projectsveltos/projectsveltos -n projectsveltos --create-namespace
```

**Please note:** Sveltos pods assume to be running in the *projectsveltos* namespace.

## Get Sveltos Statusâ€‹

Get Sveltos status and verify all pods are up and running

## Next Steps

Contiunue with the **Sveltoctl** command-line interface (CLI) definition and installation [here](../sveltosctl/sveltosctl.md).

[^1]: sveltos-agent will be deployed if there is at least one Classifier instance in the management cluster. Drift detection manager will be deployed if there is a ClusterProfile instance with SyncMode set to *ContinuousWithDriftDetection*.
[^2]: If Prometheus operator is not present in your management cluster, you will see (and can ignore) following error: *error: unable to recognize "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/projectsveltos/sveltos/main/manifest/manifest.yaml": no matches for kind "ServiceMonitor" in version "monitoring.coreos.com/v1"*
