## What is Sveltos?

Sveltos is a set of Kubernetes controllers deployed in the management cluster. From the management cluster, it can manage add-ons and applications to multiple clusters.

## Air-Gapped Installation

!!! note
    This documentation assumes that Sveltos is installed using `Helm`.

Sveltos can be installed in an **air-gapped** environment. An air-gapped environment is a **highly secure** environment completely **cut off** from the **Internet** and any other external networks. That implies, getting the required Sveltos images from the `Docker Hub` is not possible. This method can also be useful if the cluster runs in an environment where access to certain image registries is restricted and a custom registry or registry cache needs to be used (e.g. in large enterprises).

When installing Sveltos using the official `Helm chart`, the *drift-detection-manager* and the *sveltos-agent* will be deployed in each managed cluster or on the management cluster when `agent.managementCluster=true` is set. However, in restricted environments, additional values are required for the installation. The *drift-detection-manager* and the *sveltos-agent* deployments will be dynamically deployed instead of from the Sveltos installation directly. This means that the patches to these deployments are done during runtime instead of upfront.

There are two types of patches that can be applied:

- [Strategic Merge Patch](http://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/manage-kubernetes-objects/update-api-object-kubectl-patch/)
- [JSON Patch (RFC6902)](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc6902)

Patches of both types can be persisted in a `ConfigMap` and passed to the components that will deploy the *drift-detection-manager* and the *sveltos-agent* respectively.

The `Helm` chart offers a way to only specify the patches and the `ConfigMaps` will be created automatically so that they will be applied to the deployments before applying the *drift-detection-manager* and *sveltos-agent*.

## drift-detection-manager Configuration

To customize the *drift-detection-manager* deployment you can add your patches to the `Helm` values like here:

```yaml
...
addonController:
  driftDetectionManagerPatchConfigMap:
    data:
      patch: |-
        apiVersion: apps/v1
        kind: Deployment
        metadata:
          name: drift-detection-manager
        spec:
          template:
            spec:
              imagePullSecrets:
                - name: my-registry-secret
              containers:
                - name: manager
                  image: registry.company.io/projectsveltos/drift-detection-manager:dev
...
```

This example makes use of the `Strategic Merge Patch`. The key of the `data` in the `ConfigMap` (here `patch`) is arbitrary and can be changed to any other value.

The *drift-detection-manager* image is located [here](https://hubgw.docker.com/layers/projectsveltos/drift-detection-manager/dev/images/sha256-d31b3d57ee446ab216d7b925f35ef3da50de5161dff17ce2ef7c35f5bdd9c539).

## sveltos-agent Configuration

The *sveltos-agent* can be patched in the same way. In order to edit the deployment the following values can be used:

```yaml
...
classifierManager:
  agentPatchConfigMap:
    data:
      image-patch: |-
        - op: replace
          path: /spec/template/spec/containers/0/image
          value: registry.company.io/projectsveltos/sveltos-agent:dev
        - op: add
          path: /spec/template/spec/imagePullSecrets
          value:
            - name: my-registry-secret
...
```

This example makes use of `JSON Patch (RFC 6902)` to change deployment values. It's not limited to only one item in `data`.

The *sveltos-agent* **image** is located [here](https://hubgw.docker.com/layers/projectsveltos/sveltos-agent/dev/images/sha256-d2c23f55e4585e9cfd103547bd238aef42f8cedb1d8ca23600bd393710669b37).

The *sveltos-agent* will be deployed in the **management** cluster with the bellow settings.

- **Custom image from private registry**: registry.company.io/projectsveltos/sveltos-agent:dev
- **Private registry credentials**: my-registry-secret (the secret must be present in the **projectsveltos** namespace)[^1]

!!! tip
    Replace the `image: registry.company.io/projectsveltos/sveltos-agent:dev` argument with your private registry details.

    To create the `my-registry-secret` Secret, provide your credentials directly using the command: ```kubectl create secret docker-registry my-registry-secret -n projectsveltos --docker-server=<your-registry-server> --docker-username=<your-name> --docker-password=<your-pword> --docker-email=<your-email>```

## Helm Installation

On the Kubernetes **management** cluster, install ProjectSveltos!

```
$ helm repo add projectsveltos <private-repo-url>

$ helm repo update

$ helm install projectsveltos projectsveltos/projectsveltos -n projectsveltos --create-namespace -f custom_values.yaml

$ helm list -n projectsveltos
```

!!! note
    The `custom_values.yaml` file holds all the changes performed on the Helm chart above.

## Next Steps

Continue with the **sveltoctl** command-line interface (CLI) definition and installation [here](../sveltosctl/sveltosctl.md).

[^1]: A Sveltos ClusterProfile can deploy your Secret to managed clusters. Assuming the Secret is named __image-pull-secret__ and resides in the __default__ namespace, it will be deployed to all clusters labeled __environment: air-gapped__
```
    apiVersion: config.projectsveltos.io/v1beta1
    kind: ClusterProfile

      name: deploy-resources
