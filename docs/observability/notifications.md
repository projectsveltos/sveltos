When you create a ClusterProfile instance using Sveltos, it automatically starts watching for clusters that match the ClusterProfile's clusterSelector field. Once a match is found, [Sveltos](https://github.com/projectsveltos) deploys all of the referenced add-ons, such as helm charts or Kubernetes resource YAMLs, in the matching workload cluster.

After all the necessary add-ons are deployed, you might want to perform other operations, such as running a CI/CD pipeline. However, it's important to ensure that the cluster is healthy, i.e, all necessary add-ons are deployed, before proceeding. To help with this, Sveltos can be configured to assess the cluster health and send notifications if there are any changes.

These notifications can be used by other tools to perform additional actions or trigger workflows. With Sveltos, you can easily deploy and manage Kubernetes add-ons, while ensuring the health and stability of your clusters.

## ClusterHealthCheck

[ClusterHealthCheck](https://github.com/projectsveltos/libsveltos/raw/main/api/v1alpha1/clusterhealthcheck_type.go) is the CRD introduce to:

1. define the cluster health checks;
2. instruct Sveltos when and how to send notifications.

### Cluster Selection

The clusterSelector field is a Kubernetes label selector. Sveltos uses it to detect all the clusters to assess health and send notifications about.

### LivenessChecks
The livenessCheck field is a list of __cluster liveness checks__ to evaluate.

Currently supported types are:

1. __Addons__: Addons type instructs Sveltos to evaluate state of add-ond deployment in such a cluster;
2. __HealthCheck__: HealthCheck type allows to define a custom health check for any Kubernetes type.

### Notifications
The notifications fields is a list of all __notifications__ to be sent when liveness check states change.

Currently supported types are:

### HealthCheck CRD
To define a custom health check, simply create a [HealthCheck](https://github.com/projectsveltos/libsveltos/blob/main/api/v1alpha1/healthcheck_type.go) instance.

Its Spec section contains following fields:

1. ```Spec.Group*/*Spec.Version*/*Spec.Kind`` fields indicating which Kubernetes resources the HealthCheck is for. Sveltos will watch and evaluate those resources anytime a change happens;
2. ```Spec.Namespace``` field can be used to filter resources by namespace;
3. ```Spec.LabelFilters``` field can be used to filter resources by labels;
4. ```Spec.Script``` can contain a [Lua](https://www.lua.org/pil/contents.html) script, which define a custom health check.

The Lua script must contain a function `evaluate()` that returns a table with a status field (__Healthy__/__Progressing__/__Degraded__/__Suspended__) and optional message field.

When providing Sveltos with a [Lua script](https://www.lua.org/), Sveltos expects following format:

1. must contain a function ```function evaluate()```. This is the function that is directly invoked and passed a Kubernetes resource (inside the function ```obj``` represents the passed in Kubernetes resource);
2. must return a Lua table with following fields:
   1. status: which can be set to either one of	__Healthy__/__Progressing__/__Degraded__/__Suspended__;
   2. ignore: this is a bool indicating whether Sveltos should ignore this resource. If hs.ignore is set to true, Sveltos will ignore the resource causing that result;
   3. message: this is a string that can be set and Sveltos will print if set.

In the follwoing example[^1], we are creating an HealthCheck that watches for all ConfigMap.
hs is the health status object we will return to Sveltos. It must contain a status attribute which indicates whether the resource is Healthy, Progressing, Degraded or Suspended. By default we set it to Healthy and hs.ignore=true, since we donâ€™t want to mess with the status of other, non-OPA ConfigMaps. Optionally, the health status object may also contain a message.

Identify if the ConfigMap is indeed an OPA policy or another kind of ConfigMap. If it is a OPA policy, retrieve the value of the openpolicyagent.org/policy-status annotation. The annotation is set to {"status":"ok"} if the policy was loaded successfully, if errors occurred during loading (e.g., because the policy contained a syntax error) the cause will be reported in the annotation. Depending on the value of the annotation, we set the status and message attributes appropriately.

At the end, we return the hs object to Sveltos.

```yaml
apiVersion: lib.projectsveltos.io/v1alpha1
kind: HealthCheck
metadata:
  name: opa-configmaps
spec:
  resourceSelectors:
  - group: ""
    version: v1
    kind: ConfigMap
  evaluateHealth: |
    function evaluate()
      statuses = {}

      status = "Healthy"
      message = ""

      local opa_annotation = "openpolicyagent.org/policy-status"
     
      for _,resource in ipairs(resources) do
        if resource.metadata.annotations ~= nil then
          if resource.metadata.annotations[opa_annotation] ~= nil then
            if obj.metadata.annotations[opa_annotation] == '{"status":"ok"}' then
              status = "Healthy"
              message = "Policy loaded successfully"
            else
              status = "Degraded"
              message = obj.metadata.annotations[opa_annotation]
            end
            table.insert(statuses, {resource=resource, status = status, message = message})  
          end
        end
      end  
      local hs = {}
      if #statuses > 0 then
        hs.resources = statuses 
      end
      return hs
    end
```

Following ClusterHealthCheck, will sends a Webex message as notification anytime a ConfigMap
with an incorrect OPA policy is found.

```yaml
apiVersion: lib.projectsveltos.io/v1alpha1
kind: ClusterHealthCheck
metadata:
 name: hc
spec:
 clusterSelector: env=fv
 livenessChecks:
 - name: deployment
   type: HealthCheck
   livenessSourceRef:
     kind: HealthCheck
     apiVersion: lib.projectsveltos.io/v1alpha1
     name: opa-configmaps
 notifications:
 - name: webex
   type: Webex
   notificationRef:
     apiVersion: v1
     kind: Secret
     name: webex
     namespace: default
```

When writing an HealthCheck with Lua, it might be handy to validate it before using it.
In order to do so, clone [sveltos-agent](https://github.com/projectsveltos/sveltos-agent) repo.
Then in *pkg/evaluation/healthchecks* directory, create a directory for your resource if one does not exist already. If a directory already exists, create a subdirectory. Inside it, create:

1. file named *healthcheck.yaml* containing the HealthCheck instance with Lua script;
2. file named *healthy.yaml* containing a Kubernetes resource supposed to be Healthy for the Lua script created in #1 (this is optional);
3. file named *progressing.yaml* containing a Kubernetes resource supposed to be Progressing for the Lua script created in #1 (this is optional);
4. file named *degraded.yaml* containing a Kubernetes resource supposed to be Degraded for the Lua script created in #1 (this is optional);
3. file named *suspended.yaml* containing a Kubernetes resource supposed to be Suspended for the Lua script created in #1 (this is optional);
5. *make test*

That will load the Lua script, pass it the healthy (if available), progressing (if available), degraded (if available), suspended (if available) resources and verify result is the expected one.

## Notifications and multi-tenancy

If following label is set on HealthCheck instance created by tenant admin

```
projectsveltos.io/admin-name: <admin>
```

Sveltos will make sure tenant admin can define notifications only looking at resources it has been [authorized to by platform admin](../multi-tenancy.md).

Sveltos suggests using following Kyverno ClusterPolicy, which will take care of adding proper label to each HealthCheck at creation time.

```yaml
apiVersion: kyverno.io/v1
kind: ClusterPolicy
metadata:
  name: add-labels
  annotations:
    policies.kyverno.io/title: Add Labels
    policies.kyverno.io/description: >-
      Adds projectsveltos.io/admin-name label on each HealthCheck
      created by tenant admin. It assumes each tenant admin is
      represented in the management cluster by a ServiceAccount.
spec:
  background: false
  rules:
  - exclude:
      any:
      - clusterRoles:
        - cluster-admin
    match:
      all:
      - resources:
          kinds:
          - HealthCheck
    mutate:
      patchStrategicMerge:
        metadata:
          labels:
            +(projectsveltos.io/serviceaccount-name): '{{serviceAccountName}}'
            +(projectsveltos.io/serviceaccount-namespace): '{{serviceAccountNamespace}}'
    name: add-labels
  validationFailureAction: enforce
```
