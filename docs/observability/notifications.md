## Introduction to Notifications

When a ClusterProfile is instantiated using Sveltos, it automatically watches for clusters that match the ClusterProfile clusterSelector field. When a match is found, [Sveltos](https://github.com/projectsveltos) deploys all of the referenced add-ons, such as helm charts or Kubernetes resources.

Once the necessary add-ons are deployed, there might be a need to perform other operations on the cluster, such as running a CI/CD pipeline. However, it is important to ensure that the cluster is healthy, i.e., all necessary add-ons are deployed, before proceeding. Sveltos can be configured to **assess** the cluster health and send notifications if any changes are detected.

The notifications can be used by other tools to perform additional actions or trigger workflows. Sveltos will ensure the necessary Kubernetes add-ons are deployed and managed while ensuring the health and stability of the clusters.

## ClusterHealthCheck

[ClusterHealthCheck](https://github.com/projectsveltos/libsveltos/raw/main/api/v1alpha1/clusterhealthcheck_type.go) is the CRD that can be used to:

1. Define the cluster health checks;
2. Instruct Sveltos **when** and **how** to send notifications

### Cluster Selection

The `clusterSelector` field is a Kubernetes label selector. Sveltos uses it to detect all the clusters to assess health and send out notifications.

### LivenessChecks
The `livenessCheck` field is a list of __cluster liveness checks__ to be evaluated.

The supported types are:

1. __Addons__: Addons type instructs Sveltos to evaluate state of add-ond deployment in such a cluster;
2. __HealthCheck__: HealthCheck type allows to define a custom health check for any Kubernetes type.

### Notifications
The notifications fields is a list of all __notifications__ to be sent when the liveness check state changes.

The supported types are:

1. <img src="../../assets/kubernetes_logo.png" alt="Kubernetes" width="25" /> Kubernetes events (__reason=ClusterHealthCheck__);
2. <img src="../../assets/slack_logo.png" alt="Slack" width="25" />  Slack message; 
3. <img src="../../assets/webex_logo.png" alt="Webex" width="25" />  Webex message;
4. <img src="../../assets/discord_logo.png" alt="Discord" width="25" />  Discord message


### HealthCheck CRD
To define a custom health check, simply create a [HealthCheck](https://github.com/projectsveltos/libsveltos/blob/main/api/v1alpha1/healthcheck_type.go) instance.

The `HealthCheck` specification can can contain the below fields:

1. ```Spec.Group*/*Spec.Version*/*Spec.Kind`` fields indicates which Kubernetes resources the HealthCheck is for. Sveltos will watch and evaluate these resources anytime a change occurs;
2. ```Spec.Namespace``` field can be used to filter resources by namespace;
3. ```Spec.LabelFilters``` field can be used to filter resources by labels;
4. ```Spec.Script``` can contain a [Lua](https://www.lua.org/pil/contents.html) script, which define a custom health check.

The Lua script must contain the function `evaluate()` that returns a table with a status field (__Healthy__/__Progressing__/__Degraded__/__Suspended__) and optional message field.

When providing Sveltos with a [Lua script](https://www.lua.org/), Sveltos expects following format:

1. Must contain a function ```function evaluate()```. The function is directly invoked and passed a Kubernetes resource (inside the function ```obj``` represents the passed in Kubernetes resource);
2.Must return a Lua table with following fields:
   1. `status`: which can be set to either one of	__Healthy__/__Progressing__/__Degraded__/__Suspended__;
   2. `ignore`: is a boolean field indicating whether Sveltos should ignore the resource. If hs.ignore is set to `true`, Sveltos will ignore the resource causing that result;
   3. `message`: is a string that can be set and Sveltos will print a message if it is set

## Example: ConfigMap HealthCheck

In the follwoing example[^1], we are creating an HealthCheck that watches all the ConfigMap Kubernetes resources.

`hs` is the health status object we will return to Sveltos. It must contain a `status` attribute which indicates whether the resource is `Healthy`, `Progressing`, `Degraded` or `Suspended`. By default,the status is set to `Healthy` and the `hs.ignore` is set to `true`, as we do not want to mess with the status of other, non-OPA ConfigMaps. Optionally, the health status object may also contain a message.

In this example, we want to identify if the ConfigMap is an OPA policy or another kind of ConfigMap. If it is a OPA policy, we retrieve the value of the openpolicyagent.org/policy-status annotation. The annotation is set to {"status":"ok"} if the policy loaded successfully. If errors occurred during loading (e.g., the policy contained a syntax error) the cause will be reported in the annotation. Depending on the value of the annotation, we set the status and message attributes appropriately.

At the end, we return the `hs` object to Sveltos.

```yaml
apiVersion: lib.projectsveltos.io/v1alpha1
kind: HealthCheck
metadata:
  name: opa-configmaps
spec:
  resourceSelectors:
  - group: ""
    version: v1
    kind: ConfigMap
  evaluateHealth: |
    function evaluate()
      statuses = {}

      status = "Healthy"
      message = ""

      local opa_annotation = "openpolicyagent.org/policy-status"
     
      for _,resource in ipairs(resources) do
        if resource.metadata.annotations ~= nil then
          if resource.metadata.annotations[opa_annotation] ~= nil then
            if obj.metadata.annotations[opa_annotation] == '{"status":"ok"}' then
              status = "Healthy"
              message = "Policy loaded successfully"
            else
              status = "Degraded"
              message = obj.metadata.annotations[opa_annotation]
            end
            table.insert(statuses, {resource=resource, status = status, message = message})  
          end
        end
      end  
      local hs = {}
      if #statuses > 0 then
        hs.resources = statuses 
      end
      return hs
    end
```

The below `ClusterHealthCheck` resources, will send a Webex message as notification if a ConfigMap
with an incorrect OPA policy is detected.

```yaml
apiVersion: lib.projectsveltos.io/v1alpha1
kind: ClusterHealthCheck
metadata:
 name: hc
spec:
 clusterSelector: env=fv
 livenessChecks:
 - name: deployment
   type: HealthCheck
   livenessSourceRef:
     kind: HealthCheck
     apiVersion: lib.projectsveltos.io/v1alpha1
     name: opa-configmaps
 notifications:
 - name: webex
   type: Webex
   notificationRef:
     apiVersion: v1
     kind: Secret
     name: webex
     namespace: default
```

**Note:**

If the Lua language is preferred to write the HealthCheck, it might be handy to validate the definition before use.

This can be achieved by cloning the [sveltos-agent](https://github.com/projectsveltos/sveltos-agent) repository. In the *pkg/evaluation/healthchecks* directory, create a directory for the deployed resources if it does not exist already. If a directory already exists, create a subdirectory instead.

In the directory or the subdirectory, create the below points.

1. The file named *healthcheck.yaml* containing the HealthCheck instance with Lua script;
2. The file named *healthy.yaml* containing a Kubernetes resource supposed to be Healthy for the Lua script created in #1 (this is optional);
3. The file named *progressing.yaml* containing a Kubernetes resource supposed to be Progressing for the Lua script created in #1 (this is optional);
4. The file named *degraded.yaml* containing a Kubernetes resource supposed to be Degraded for the Lua script created in #1 (this is optional);
3. The file named *suspended.yaml* containing a Kubernetes resource supposed to be Suspended for the Lua script created in #1 (this is optional);
5. *make test*

As mentioned above, one of the following statuses will get returned (`Healthy`, `Progressing`, `Degraded` or `Suspended`) once the resources are verified.

## Notifications and multi-tenancy

If the below label is set on the HealthCheck instance created by the tenant admin

```
projectsveltos.io/admin-name: <admin>
```

Sveltos will ensure the tenant admin can define notifications only by looking at the resources it has been [authorized to by platform admin](../features/multi-tenancy.md).

Sveltos suggests using the below Kyverno ClusterPolicy, which takes care of adding proper labels to each HealthCheck at creation time.

```yaml
apiVersion: kyverno.io/v1
kind: ClusterPolicy
metadata:
  name: add-labels
  annotations:
    policies.kyverno.io/title: Add Labels
    policies.kyverno.io/description: >-
      Adds projectsveltos.io/admin-name label on each HealthCheck
      created by tenant admin. It assumes each tenant admin is
      represented in the management cluster by a ServiceAccount.
