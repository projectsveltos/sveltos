## Example: Deployment Health Notification

The below `HealthCheck` YAML definition considers all the cluster Deployments. It matches any `Deployment`:

1. With the number of available replicas matching the number of requested replicas, it is marked as `Healthy`;
2. With the number of available replicas different than the number of requested replicas, it is marked as `Progressing`;
3. With the number of unavailable replicas set and different than zero, it is marked as `Degraded`.

```yaml
apiVersion: lib.projectsveltos.io/v1alpha1
kind: HealthCheck
metadata:
  name: deployment-replicas
spec:
  resourceSelectors:
  - group: "apps"
    version: v1
    kind: Deployment
  evaluateHealth: |
    function evaluate()
      local statuses = {}
      status = "Progressing"
      message = ""

      for _,resource in ipairs(resources) do
        if resource.status ~= nil then
          if resource.status.availableReplicas ~= nil then
            if resource.status.availableReplicas == resource.spec.replicas then
              status = "Healthy"
            else
              status = "Progressing"
              message = "expected replicas: " .. resource.spec.replicas .. " available: " .. resource.status.availableReplicas
            end
          end
          if resource.status.unavailableReplicas ~= nil then
            status = "Degraded"
            message = "deployments have unavailable replicas"
          end
        end
        table.insert(statuses, {resource=resource, status = status, message = message})
      end
      
      local hs = {}
      if #statuses > 0 then
        hs.resources = statuses 
      end
      return hs
    end
```
