## What is an Internal Developer Platform?

There are many definitions around what an Internal Developer Platform or as commonly known IDP is. An easy-to-understand definition from [Atlassian](https://www.atlassian.com/developer-experience/internal-developer-platform) is the following:
> An internal developer platform (IDP) is a self-service interface between developers and the underlying infrastructure, tools, and processes required to build, deploy, and manage software applications.

## Sveltos Event Framework and IDP

On top of managing add-ons and applications, Sveltos can be used as a framework to build an Internal Developer Platform. Sveltos [Event Framework](../events/addon_event_deployment.md) allows platform teams to **define events**, and **respond** to events by deploying resources.

### How it works?

Imagine an event like the creation of a **new service** or a **namespace** in a specified cluster. Sveltos can **automatically respond** to such `events` by deploying new resources either within the same cluster or across different clusters.

This cross-cluster feature makes it easy to **automate** tasks across different clusters. For example, when a namespace with a specific label is created in a cluster, Sveltos can automatically set up a new database in a dedicated cluster reserved for databases.

For easy to follow deployment examples, check out the [Event Framework Section](../events/db-as-a-service-multiple-db-per-cluster.md).


## Sveltos and NATS Integration

[NATS](https://nats.io/) is a lightweight, high-performance messaging system optimized for speed and scalability. It excels at publish/subscribe communication. [JetStream](https://docs.nats.io/nats-concepts/jetstream) enhances NATS with robust streaming and data management features, including message persistence, flow control, and ordered delivery, creating a powerful platform for modern distributed systems.

With this integration in place, Sveltos can connect to a NATS server and listen for CloudEvents published on NATS subjects. That means Sveltos is not limited to events related to Kubernetes resources!
